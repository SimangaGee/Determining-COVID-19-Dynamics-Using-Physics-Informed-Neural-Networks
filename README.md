# Determining-COVID-19-Dynamics-Using-Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks
A Physics Informed Neural Networks framework to understand the dynamics of COVID-19, governed by the S-I-R-D system of mathematical equations. This focuses on finding the dynamics of COVID, infection, recovery, and death rates; thus, predicting the active infections, recovered, susceptible and deceased timely.
